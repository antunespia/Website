Our project aims to create a product capable of delivering reliable data to the Earth Sciences Department in our University so they can use that data to carry with several studies of how the rain affects the level of the water on ground-waters. This data will be taken by soil humidity sensors, connected with an ESP. The data will be uploaded to a SQL database, created by ourselves and visible in a Website created in HTML and CSS and hosted in a BlueHost domain.
